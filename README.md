# kitty-grid
fluid and modern scss grid based on flexbox, bem ready :)

It include 2 files:
1. whith desktop-first set - i use it on my work :(
2. whith mobile-first set - if you like bootstrap or this approach at whole import this file to your project

## How it works 
> i will describe desktop-first set, if you need mobile-first i think you know what to do :)

Kitty grid system based on scss mixins and default css classes which set containers, rows, and columns to layout and align content.

Use `<div class="container">...</div>` to wrap you content, it has max-width 1190px by default and padding 15px
Use `<div class="container-fluid">...</div>` to add full width container
