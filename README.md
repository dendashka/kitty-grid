It include 2 files:

2. with mobile-first set - if you like bootstrap or this approach at whole import this file to your project

## How it works 
> i will describe desktop-first set, if you need mobile-first(bootstrap) i think you know what to do :)

Kitty grid system based on scss mixins and default css classes which set containers, rows, and columns to layout and align content.

> Use `<div class="container">...</div>` to wrap you content, it has max-width 1190px by default and padding 15px

> Use `<div class="container-fluid">...</div>` to add full width container
